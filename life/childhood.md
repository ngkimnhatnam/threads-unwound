Life is a spool of threads where it all begins at one end.

The spool unravels slowly, just like how we live each and every day.

The threads are just not time. It represents experiences, emotions, lessons, and growth.

Not all spools are the same. Some are vibrant and colorful, while others are dull and monotonous.

Some are thick and strong, while others are thin and fragile.

Some spools have knots and tangles, while others are smooth and straight.

But they all share one thing - it all ends at some point.

And at the center of the spool, we find the essence of life. The core that holds everything together.

Memories, regrets, joys, sorrows, acceptance, denial and everything in between.

Isn't it beautiful?

How will your own thread unwind?
