# Girlhood

You take your first steps into the world as a young girl, full of dreams and wonder. The days are filled with stories, friendships, and the gentle unfolding of your unique path.

**Choice:**

- Do you join the group painting by the garden, or help the teacher with a class project?

**Consequence:**

- If you join the painting group, you discover a love for art and make creative friends.
- If you help the teacher, you learn responsibility and earn trust from those around you.
