# Boyhood

You take your first steps into the world as a young boy, full of curiosity and energy. The days are filled with new discoveries, scraped knees, and laughter that echoes through the playground.

**Choice:**

- Do you befriend the shy child at the edge of the playground, or join the group playing soccer?

**Consequence:**

- If you befriend the shy child, you gain a loyal friend who stands by you through thick and thin.
- If you join the soccer game, you learn teamwork and the thrill of competition.
